# Chaser

Despite the [Rucoy Online 2D MMORPG](https://www.rucoyonline.com)'s vibe, there are still a lot of scammers in the game, which amount we are striving to reduce. Using this application, it is simple to determine whether a user is a scammer.

## üß™ Testing

This project utilizes the [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) framework for creating test cases. It also incorporates [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq) for mocking objects and [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) to generate fake data. To run all the tests, execute the following command from the root directory in your command prompt:

```sh
dotnet test
